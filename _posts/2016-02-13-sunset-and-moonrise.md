**Does a sunset in the west and a moonrise in the east ever happen at exactly the same time?**

Yes, a sunset and moonrise can occur at about the same time. Specifically, it occurs on the night of a full moon! Let’s convince ourselves of why this is...

Whenever we need to think about the specifics of <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solar/moonphase.html">moon phases</a>, we should think about how the positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon relate to one another. For example, a new moon occurs when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth, so we are unable to see any illumination. On the other hand, when we observe a full moon at night, it’s illuminated face is due to sunlight shining on it - the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon. This scenario is exactly what we need to be able to see both the sunset and moonrise within minutes of each other!

Above is a little figure I made to pictorially represent what I described above. Now, the sunset and moonrise do not occur at exactly the same time because the Moon’s orbit is slightly inclined with respect to the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. Even so, with a little planning, you can observe three very impressive astronomical events (sunset, moonrise, and the full moon) all in one night.
