**Does the degenerate matter inside a black hole have a temperature, or is it so compact it's functionally at absolute zero?**

**Also, if event horizon scales with mass, does matter inside the event horizon have a specifiable density?**

Thanks for a very intriguing question.

The basic answer is that no one knows and that it
depends on details, but let me elaborate.

An important perspective is that the inside of a black hole
is very unlike a star. Stars, including white dwarfs with
degenerate electrons and neutron stars with degenerate
neutrons, are in [hydrostatic equilibrium](http://www.astronomynotes.com/starsun/s7.htm); the
outward pressure gradients balance the inward pull
of gravity. The essence of the space within the event
horizon of a black hole is that everything is collapsing
inward. In that case, the level of degeneracy of electrons
or neutrons depends on how the black hole formed,
from a collapsing star or otherwise, and, if a star,
what kind of star. Another key point is whether the
matter is degenerate or not, gravity will overwhelm
any pressure, so any bit of matter must rush headlong
into the "singularity," in a short time -- a fraction of a
second for a normal stellar-mass case, somewhat longer
for a supermassive black hole. With that perspective
as background, the matter inside a black hole, in the
brief interval after it passes the event horizon and
before it hits the singularity, is likely to have some
temperature and may or may not be degenerate.
I cannot think of a reason that it should, at a given
moment, be at absolute zero.

This perspective also addresses the second part of
your question. Whatever density matter has as it
crosses the event horizon, that density will rapidly
increase as the matter plummets inward. Formally
in Einstein's General Relativity, the density goes to
infinity at the singularity. We now understand that
cannot be true. That condition of zero size and infinite
density contradicts the quantum theory. We will not
know what truly happens at the "singularity" until
we have a complete theory of [quantum gravity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity), string
theory or something else.
